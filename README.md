## About

At a glance: this project is an implementation of React + Redux, in particular as a means of using Redux to facilitate reusable components that maintain control of their own state, but could also share it elsewhere (without "lifting state up"). Mostly I just wanted to learn concepts and see what was possible.

Try clicking some numbers, resetting things, watching the instance and grand totals, plus the debugging blocks. Refer to the "About" block at the bottom of the app for more info.
